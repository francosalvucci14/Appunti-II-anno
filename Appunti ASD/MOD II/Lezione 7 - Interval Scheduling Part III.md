# Scheduling to Minimize Lateness

**Minimizing lateness problem**.
- **Single** resource processes **one** job at a time.
- Job j requires $t_j$ units of processing time and is due at time $d_j$.
- Solution: If j starts at time $s_j$, it finishes at time $f_j = s_j +t_j$.
- Lateness: $l_j = max \{ 0,f_j - d_j \}$
- _**Goal**: schedule all jobs to minimize maximum lateness $L = max \{l_j\}$_
