# Minimum Spanning Tree

>[!important]- Definition
>Given a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ with real-valued edge weights $c_e$, an MST is a subset of the edges $T\subseteq E$ such that $T$ is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is minimized

Cayley's Theorem:  There are $n^{n-2}$ spanning trees of $K_n$ (can't solve by brute force)
